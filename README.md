# S1G-RF-firmwware
S1G-RF 915MHZ radio firmware repository, STM32L052C8T6 Firmware
Control firmware for the S1G-RF 915MHZ Open Source long range radio platform.
Written in C on STM32L0 HAL driver library for the STM32L052C8T6 ARM Cortex M0+
microprocessor. The Software supports use of the radio as a perioheral or slave
device to another system over USB, SPI, or USART serial interfaces.

This project makes use of ADI's no-OS driver code found here:
